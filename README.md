**ABOUT**

* The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. 
* Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality. 
* All users should be able to have read functionality.
* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. 
* A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. 
For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. 
* Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.


* Does at least one of your classes have all CRUD methods implemented in your app?
* Are you able to view both sides of the many-many relationship? For a particular instance of a class, are you able to view all of the instances of the other class that are related to it?
* Are users able to register, log in and log out with Identity?
* Is Create, Update and Delete functionality limited to authenticated users?
* Is the project in a polished, portfolio-quality state?
* Was required functionality in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline?
* Does the project demonstrate all of this week's concepts? If prompted, are you able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology?

* Have separate roles for admins and logged-in users. Only admins should be able to add, update and delete.
Add an order form that only logged-in users can access. 
* A logged-in user should be able to create, read, update and delete their own order.
